    "### Motivation\n",
    "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and the [3rd cause among people 65 and older](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/number-alzheimers-deaths-found-be-underreported). It is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that progresively damages an individual's cognitive functioning. It usually starts with memory loss and a worsening of thinking capabilities, and it develops to problems with language, orientation and loss of body functions, ultimately leading to death. The life expectancy following the diagnosis of the disease ranges from 3 to 8 years depending on the individual. The disease is significatnly more common in adults in an advanced age, usually over 65 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there is no cure for the disease and the causes are yet not completely understood. Given the relevance of Alzheimer there is a big global effort put in research of diagnosis and treatment. One of the biggest projects is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) whose data will be used in this project."

    "The Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is a joint research initiative whose goal is to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatments for Alzheimer's Disease. As part of this study researchers at more than 60 sites in the United States and Canada collected and are colecting data from over a thousand participants. The types of data collected range from demographics and family history to genetics, neuropsycologichal tests, imaging or biomarkers. The project is divided in several phases in time: ADNI1 (2004-2009), ADNIGO (2009-2001), ADNI2 (2011-2016) and ADNI3 (2016-2021).\n",

    "\n",
    "1) To build a model able to predict if Alzheimer's disease will be developed in an individual using the data provided by ADNI. This is very important since early diagnosis of Alzheimer can lead to a slower progression of the disease by accessing different treatments [[source]](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/why-get-checked).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) To identify the most relevant information or tests that allow us predicting a diagnosis. This can help reducing the cost and effort spent in the diagnosis phase by reducing the number of tests to the most essential.\n"

    "### Data Categories\n",
    "In order to start having a big picture of the data, we are going to describe roughly the different categories in which we will focus. After doing some research online and taking a look to the data, we have decided to limit our scope to the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demographics and Medical History\n",
    "The study collected some basic information about the patients including age, gender, race or civil status. It also collected some family history information like the fact that certain relatives developed different kinds of illnesses including Alzheimer itself. This category of information is the easiest to understand since it doesn't require any particular background.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neuropsychological Tests\n",
    "One of the most valuable and broadly used information provided as part of the study are neuropsychological tests. This often consists on a set of tasks the patient has to perform and the goal is to evaluate the cognitive function of the brain. They are often focused on a specific part or pathway of this organ and they produce a particular score that is then evaluated in a predefined scale. Some of the most widely used neuropsychological tests include CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating), FAQ (Functional Activities Questionnaire) or MMSE (Miniâ€“Mental State Examination).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biomarkers\n",
    "A biomarker is some biological indicator that is linked to a particular disease, in this case Alzheimer. The study perform many biological tests to the patients including different blood or urine tests. However one of the most used substances to obtain biomarkers from is the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) which is found in the brain and the spinal cord. Some CSF biomarkers are different forms of the proteins Amyloid-$\\beta$ like A$\\beta$42 or Tau like p-tau.\n",

    "  </tr>\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Brain Imaging Data\n",
    "Along the different phases of the study 2 main technologies have been used to capture images of the brain: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). During the development of Alzheimer Disease many changes happen in the brain including variations in shape and volume, and deposits of toxic proteins like the aforementioned amyloid plaques and tau tangles in certain areas of the brain.\n",
